## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
3. Set the desired project (e.g., `OpenSenseMapAssessment`) as the Startup Project.
4. Run the project and test the APIs using Swagger UI or Postman.

## üõ†Ô∏è General Assessments Setup    

- Both GeneralAssessment1 and GeneralAssessment2 projects are included under a single solution. To run any of the general assessment programs:
1. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
2. Right-click on the project you want to run and select "Set as Startup Project".
3. Build and run the application. 

## ‚úÖ Notes

- Make sure to restore NuGet packages before building the solution.
- Error handling have been implemented in the OpenSenseMap assessment.
- Swagger UI provides interactive documentation for testing API endpoints.
